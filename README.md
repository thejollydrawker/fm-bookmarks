## My process

### Built with

- LitElement v.3
- Webpack 5
- Typescript
- Sass

### What I learned

Basics of LitElement, some Webpack 5 shenanigans in an attempt to maybe possibly in the future use the module federaion plugin.

### Continued development

Would be lovely to take a deep dive into LitElement, in some other challenge with more 'business logic', to explore lifecycles, more specific decorators etc.. Since Lit is possibly at the moment the GOAT to build a custom component library to use it elsewhere in some proyects.

This is a es6 bundled project, maybe add a polyfill in the future for compatibility with older browsers.

### Useful resources

https://lit.dev - Lt documenatation all the way (they have a pretty lovely tutorial).
https://webpack.js.org - Webpack official documentation

Pray that webpack doesn't give an error when bundling since unfortunately there isn't much info on that on the web.
